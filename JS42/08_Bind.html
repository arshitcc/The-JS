    /*  
        Both bind and call are methods available in JavaScript that are used to manipulate how functions are invoked and what context they have access to.

        The bind() method creates a new function with the same body as the original function but with a fixed context (this value).

        It does not execute the function immediately but rather returns a new function that, when called, will have the specified context (this value).

        It is commonly used to create functions with pre-set arguments or to set the context (this) for a function permanently.

        NOTE : 
        Think of bind() as a "promise" for a function. It creates a new version of a function where you specify what this should refer to when the function is called later.
        It's like saying, "Hey function, when you get called later, always consider this to be this specific thing."
