API => Application Programming Interface, which are used to handle request from frontend-backend, database from one_language-another_language.

mostly API's are nothing but an object which is a data / database , whose structure has to be understood to perform operations on data .

=> We can use randomuser.me to generate API's 
=> For understanding the structure of API we can use any available JSON Formatter than converts the JSON objects into sa structural manner like TREE.

In this modern time, developers mostly use fetch() but fetch is just new from 6 years what about before that ? NO API's ðŸ˜‚

Earlier developers were sending XML-Http-Request were done with the help of Ajax => A technological approach mixup of Asynchronous Javascript and XML

The Requests are used to be handled with help of states, even now also in React they are handeled by states

Value	State	            Description
    0	UNSENT	            Client has been created. open() not called yet.
    1	OPENED	            open() has been called.
    2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
    3	LOADING	            Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
    4	DONE	            The operation is complete.

now in React and other frameworks also they now have their specific names for every state so from there they are called. 
No like before xhr[0],xhr[1], etc
