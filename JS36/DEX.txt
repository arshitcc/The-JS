Q. There are total 3 parameters in addEventListner()

=> 1. Event, 2. Function, 3. boolean_value(true/false)
    By default if you don't write 3rd parameter it is considered as false.

    There are some tasks which when given will not work untill you use that 3rd parameter.

    -> Event Propagation has 2 contexts
    -> Event Bubbling (false) and Event Capturing (true).
    -> Mostly used to stop Event Propagation

    ->

    -> Event Bubbling (Bottom To Top )
    -> Event Capturing (Top to Bottom)
